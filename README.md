# Face-Detection-and-Recognition
This project involves the development of face detection and recognition software using Python. The software leverages several powerful libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Keras, TensorFlow, OpenCV (cv2), and Matplotlib. For frontal face detection, the Haarcascade classifier is employed.Key Features:Face Detection: Utilizes the Haarcascade classifier for detecting frontal faces.Face Recognition: Implements deep learning techniques with Keras and TensorFlow.Data Handling: Uses Pandas for data manipulation and management.Visualization: Employs Matplotlib for visualizing data and results.Platforms: Developed using Spyder and Google Colab for an efficient coding environment.Feel free to explore the code and contribute!
